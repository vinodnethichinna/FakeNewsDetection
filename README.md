# Fake News Detection
Hi,

In todayâ€™s world where technology and the Internet are widely used for almost any imaginable purpose, spreading rumors and fake news online has become very easy. In some cases, people have trouble differentiating between the biased opinions and objective facts. There is a need for a platform on which people can verify the articles they read. Thus, to address this issue, we have come up with an idea that will help people to identify the unverified sources. As a wide variety of subjects cannot realistically be used for the implementation, to make the quality product that will provide the highest accuracy of outcome, we are limiting our scope to the Canadian Politics, which is one of the driving forces of fake news publications in the recent decades. While there is a similar tool made for U.S. politics, Canadian people will benefit greatly from the Canadian version for an opportunity to consciously vote and make informed decisions based on the verified written pieces.

To acheive this i used machine learning model and trained my model with test data and able to predict the trustworthy of news articles. The input data is obtained by scraping news websites and stored in mongodb. 

We used below models.
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Passive Aggressive Classifier.
3. Sentimental Analysis.

Thank you.
